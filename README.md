# TL;DR

AR Inkshooter(experimental project) app develeped with Unity(version:2019.4).

My source codes are placed in Assets/Scripts and Assets/Shaders folders.

# How it works

It projects transparent meshs using ARCore depthmap within compute shader for calculating vertex posiions, and paints ink as post effect on those meshes.
